# lab3-practice
Hello there! This file is just to type stuff out I guess.
Sooo... yeah, this is a test repository made for the third lab of Advanced Programming.

Let's get this bread.

I'm only writing this line to test the commit feature and the push feature. So if I commit this change, it won't actually show in the remote repository until I push the changes.
